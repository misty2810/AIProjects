✅ 1. Dual Maze Navigators
Problem Definition & Environment

Two agents must explore a maze and collect all scattered keys.
The maze consists of walls, open cells, and key locations. The environment is partially deterministic, grid-based, and fully observable. Agents share the same map and must avoid re-exploring the same cells unnecessarily.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Reads surrounding cells (walls, keys, visited).

Planning: BFS/DFS for exploring new cells and reaching keys.

Coordination: Shared visited-grid and partition logic to avoid overlap.

Action: Move (up/down/left/right), collect key.

Memory: Stores visited nodes and remaining key positions.

✅ 2. Cleaning Crew Coordination
Problem Definition & Environment

Two cleaning robots must clean dirty cells in a 2D indoor grid.
The grid contains obstacles, clean cells, and dirty areas. Robots must plan non-overlapping cleaning regions to maximize efficiency.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Detect dirt, obstacles, and cleaned cells.

Planning: Greedy/BFS/A* for shortest cleaning paths.

Coordination: Shared task list; divide grid into left/right or dynamic zones.

Action: Move, clean.

Memory: Stores cleaned cells and pending dirt locations.

✅ 3. Cooperative Path Planners
Problem Definition & Environment

Two agents must reach two separate goal points without colliding.
Movement is synchronous on a grid. Obstacles are present, and agents must plan safe simultaneous routes.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Detect agent positions, obstacles, and goals.

Planning: A* for each agent + collision-avoidance layer.

Coordination: Shared time-step simulation to avoid entering same cell.

Action: Step-by-step movement.

Memory: Stores path history and reservations for future cells.

✅ 4. Warehouse Pickup Team
Problem Definition & Environment

Agents collect and deliver packages across a warehouse grid with shelves and free paths.
Packages appear at specific locations. Robots must minimize total travel distance.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Detect package locations, shelves, free paths, and current load.

Planning: A* for movement; greedy or Hungarian algorithm for task assignment.

Coordination: Shared task queue, distance-based allocation.

Action: Pick item, move, drop item.

Memory: Store active tasks, completed deliveries.

✅ 5. Rescue Bot Squad
Problem Definition & Environment

Two rescue bots must locate and rescue victims inside a maze-like environment.
Victims may be spread across multiple regions. Obstacles block direct movement.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Detect victims, walls, paths.

Planning: BFS to find shortest routes to victims.

Coordination: Split rescue zones or assign nearest victim to each bot.

Action: Move to victim and rescue.

Memory: Store rescued victims and visited cells.

✅ 6. Dual Drone Delivery
Problem Definition & Environment

Two aerial drones deliver packages to designated grid locations with minimal overlap.
The environment includes delivery points and obstacles (e.g., no-fly zones).

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Read grid, detect obstacles, delivery destinations.

Planning: A* for flight paths; greedy assignment for delivery tasks.

Coordination: Shared flight plan and conflict avoidance.

Action: Move, deliver payload.

Memory: Stores visited cells and remaining delivery points.

✅ 7. Grid Painting Agents
Problem Definition & Environment

Two painting robots must cover assigned areas of a grid without painting over each other.
Cells start unpainted, and the grid may contain obstacles.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Check paint status and obstacles.

Planning: DFS region-based exploration.

Coordination: Divide grid into left/right zones to prevent overlap.

Action: Move, paint cell.

Memory: Maintain visited (painted) map.

✅ 8. Resource Collection Team
Problem Definition & Environment

Agents collect resources scattered across an open grid.
Each resource is at a fixed location. Efficiency is measured by resources collected and distance traveled.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Detect resource locations and obstacles.

Planning: BFS for shortest path to resource.

Coordination: Shared priority task queue (nearest-resource selection).

Action: Move and collect resource.

Memory: Track collected resources and remaining tasks.

✅ 9. Cooperative Firefighters
Problem Definition & Environment

Two agents extinguish fires spreading across a grid over time.
Fire spreads to adjacent cells each turn, requiring fast cooperative decisions.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Identify fire positions, obstacles, and spread direction.

Planning: BFS to nearest fire; fire-spread simulation.

Coordination: Allocate fire zones to agents and share updates.

Action: Move to fire, extinguish.

Memory: Track extinguished fires and predicted spreads.

✅ 10. Map Exploration Partners
Problem Definition & Environment

Two agents explore an unknown grid to uncover all reachable cells.
The map starts as unknown (?) and is revealed as agents explore.

Agent Architecture Design

Sensing: Reveal cell type on entry (free/wall).

Planning: BFS outward expansion.

Coordination: Partition grid into regions (e.g., left/right) to minimize overlap.

Action: Move, mark explored.

Memory: Store explored cells and frontier nodes.
